## Politeia (Pi) introduction

Politeia, or Pi, is the Decred proposal system. It is intended to facilitate the submission, discussion and approval/rejection of governance proposals. 

There are two broad types of proposal:
1. Proposals that aim to establish stake-voter support for a course of action, e.g. direction of software development, adopting or changing some policy.
2. Proposals that commit to spending project fund DCR, creating a budget that some entity can draw down against as they demonstrate progress towards the proposal's aim.

There is a fee for submitting a proposal (0.1 DCR), to limit the potential for proposal spamming.

When proposals are submitted, they are checked by Politeia administrators. Proposals that are deemed spam or invalid will be censored.

When proposals are submitted, a censorship token is generated, which the proposal's owner can use, in the case that their proposal was censored, to demonstrate that it was submitted but censored.

Valid proposals will be displayed on the Politeia platform, where they can be seen by all and discussed by Politeia members.

There is a registration fee (0.1 DCR) for creating a Politeia account. Only members who have paid this fee are eligible to submit proposals and comments, and to make up/down votes on the Politeia web platform. 

Up/down votes do not affect proposal funding decisions, they are used as soft signals and to determine display order. Up/down voting is not anonymous, the up/down voting history of Politeia accounts will be public information.

When a proposal is submitted and passes screening, it will be displayed on Politeia but voting will not open immediately. The proposer has discretion to participate in discussion with Decred stakeholders and make edits to their proposal, then decide when to trigger the ticket-voting interval. When voting is triggered, edits to the proposal can no longer be made.

Ticket-voting is used to determine whether proposals are approved by Decred's stake-governors. Ticket-voting is to be performed  from a Decred wallet with live tickets, it does not happen directly through the Politeia web platform.

Politeia's aim is to serve as the decision-making force behind the Decred Decentralized Autonomous Entity (DAE). This is an ambitious aim, Politeia and its accompanying processes are in an experimental stage and thus subject to change.

Initially at least, the disbursal of funds to successful proposals will be a manual process. Proposals that request funding should specify how much funding they require, denominated in a national currency like $USD. They should also specify a set of milestones or deliverables which will trigger the release of funds.

When a proposal is approved by ticket-voters, this gives a green light to the proposing entity to begin work. When the first milestone is met, they can make a request for the release of the first tranche of funding. This will be reviewed and, where satosfactory, will be processed. It is expected that, initially at least, all proposals requesting funding are paid in arrears.

An example is that stakeholders expect developers to write and show code before payment occurs. The existing contractors use this model. For example, Company 0 carries the costs (and risk) for 4-6 weeks before payout occurs. This is a feature and not a bug.  Asking for a large sum of money without incurring costs shifts the risk to the DAE and that incentivizes malicious behavior.

Some initial guidelines and examples for submitting proposals have been prepared, they are available [here](/guidelines.md) and will be iterated after Politeia's launch.
